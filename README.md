### Tweak the options

For official benchmarking:
1. `SIZE` environmental variable: the size should be **at least 25 times the read/write bandwidth** to avoid the caching impacting the result.
1. If you're testing a distributed storage solution like Longhorn, always **test against the local storage first** to know what's the baseline.
    * You can install a storage provider for local storage like [Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) for this test if you're testing with Kubernetes.
1. `CPU_IDLE_PROF` environmental variable: the CPU idleness profiling measures the CPU idleness, but it introduces extra overhead and reduces the storage performance. By default, the flag is disabled.

### Understanding the result
* **IOPS**: IO operations per second. *Higher is better.*
    * It's a measurement of how many IO operations can the device handle in a second, mainly concerning the smaller IO chunks, e.g. 4k.
* **Bandwidth**: Also called **Throughput**. *Higher is better.*
    * It's a measurement of how many data can the device read/write in a second. It's mainly concering the bigger IO chunks, e.g. 128k.
* **Latency**: The total time each request spent in the IO path. *Lower is better.*
    * It's a measurement of how efficient is the storage system to handle each request.
    * The data path overhead of a storage system can be expressed as the latency it added on top of the native storage system (SSD/NVMe).
* **CPU Idleness**: How idle is the CPU on the node that's running the test. *Higher is better.*
    * It's a measurement of the CPU load/overhead that the storage device has generated.
    * Notice this is idleness, so if the value is higher, it means the CPUs on that node have more free cycles.
    * Unforunately at this moment, this measurement cannot reflect the load on the whole cluster for distributed storage systems. But it's still a worthy reference regarding the storage client's CPU load when benchmarking (depends on how distributed storage was architected).
* For *comparison benchmark*, the `Change` column indicates what's the percentage differences when comparing the second volume to the first volume.
    * For **IOPS, Bandwidth, CPU Idleness**, positive percentage is better.
    * For **Latency**, negative percentage is better.
    * For **CPU Idleness**, instead of showing the percentage of the change, we are showing the difference.

### Understanding the result of a distributed storage system

For a distributed storage system, you always need to test the local storage first as a baseline.

Something is *wrong* when:
1. You're getting *lower read latency than local storage*.
	* You might get higher read IOPS/bandwidth than local storage due to the storage engines can aggregate performance from different nodes/disks. But you shouldn't be able to get lower latency on reading compare to the local storage.
	* If that happens, it's most likely due to there is a cache. Increase the `SIZE` to avoid that.
1. You're getting *better write IOPS/bandwidth/latency than local storage*.
	* It's almost impossible to get better write performance compare to the local storage for a distributed storage solution, unless you have a persistent caching device in front of the local storage.
	* If you are getting this result, it's likely the storage solution is not crash-consistent, so it doesn't commit the data into the disk before respond, which means in the case of an incident, you might lose data.
1. You're getting low *CPU Idleness for Latency benchmark* , e.g. <40%.
	* For **Latency**, the **CPU Idleness** should be at least 40% to guarantee the test won't be impacted by CPU starving.
	* If this happens, adding more CPUs to the node, or move to a beefer machine.

### Deploy the FIO benchmark

#### Deploy Single Volume Benchmark in Kubernetes cluster

By default:
1. The benchmark will use the **default storage class**.
    * You can specify the storage class with the YAML locally.
2. **Filesystem mode** will be used.
    * You can switch to the block mode with the YAML locally.
3. The test requires a **33G** PVC temporarily.
    * You can change the test size with the YAML locally.
    * As mentioned above, for formal benchmark, the size should be **at least 25 times the read/write bandwidth** to avoid the caching impacting the result.

Step to deploy:
1. One line to start benchmarking your default storage class:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yasker/kbench/main/deploy/fio.yaml
    ```
1. Observe the Result:
    ```
    kubectl logs -l kbench=fio -f
    ```
1. Cleanup:
    ```
    kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yasker/kbench/main/deploy/fio.yaml
    ```

Note: a single benchmark for FIO will take about 6 minutes to finish.

See [./deploy/fio.yaml](https://github.com/yasker/kbench/blob/main/deploy/fio.yaml) for available options.

#### Deploy Comparison Benchmark in Kubernetes cluster

1. Get a local copy of `fio-cmp.yaml`
    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yasker/kbench/main/deploy/fio-cmp.yaml
    ```
1. Set the storage class for each volume you want to compare.
    * By default, it's `local-path` vs `longhorn`.
    * You can install a storage provider for local storage like [Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) for this test if you're testing with Kubernetes.
1. Update the `FIRST_VOL_NAME` and `SECOND_VOL_NAME` fields in the yaml to the name you want to call them
    * By default, it's also `Local-Path` vs `Longhorn`.
1. Update the `SIZE` of PVCs and the benchmark configuration.
    * By default, the size for comparison benchmark is **`30G`**.
    * As mentioned above, for formal benchmark, the size should be **at least 25 times the read/write bandwidth** to avoid the caching impacting the result.
1. Deploy using
    ```
    kubectl apply -f fio-cmp.yaml
    ```
1. Observe the result:
    ```
    kubectl logs -l kbench=fio -f
    ```
1. Cleanup:
    ```
    kubectl delete -f fio-cmp.yaml
    ```

Note: a comparison benchmark for FIO will take about 12 minutes to finish.

See [./deploy/fio-cmp.yaml](https://github.com/yasker/kbench/blob/main/deploy/fio-cmp.yaml) for available options.

#### Run Single Volume Benchmark as Container Locally

```
docker run -v /volume yasker/kbench:latest /volume/test.img
```
e.g.
```
docker run -e "SIZE=100M" -v /volume yasker/kbench:latest /volume/test.img
```

#### Run Single Volume Benchmark as a Binary Locally

Notice in this case, `fio` is required locally.

```
./fio/run.sh <test_file> <output_prefix>
```
e.g.
```
./fio/run.sh /dev/sdaxxx ~/fio-results/Samsung_850_PRO_512GB/raw-bloc
```

Intermediate result will be saved into `<output_prefix>-iops.json`, `<output_prefix>-bandwidth.json` and `<output_prefix>-latency.json`.
The output will be printed out as well as saved into `<output_prefix>.summary`.
